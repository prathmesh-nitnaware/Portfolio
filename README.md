# 🧭 Explorer Map – Prathmesh’s Creative Journey

> Exploring Ideas. Building Worlds.

Welcome to my interactive developer portfolio – styled like an explorer’s map!  
This site is not just a collection of projects – it’s an experience through my journey as a creative developer, designer, and problem solver.

## 🧠 Inspiration

This project blends creativity with structure. Instead of a generic dev portfolio, I designed an **adventurer-themed journey** with landmarks that reflect my milestones — tech skills, academic climbs, project ruins, and hidden gems.

Because a portfolio shouldn’t just say who you are —  
it should reflect **how you think**.
